UK councils fear bankruptcy amid Covid-19 costs

In June 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit and BBC Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53069772) that some of the largest UK councils said they might have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agreed to further support.

The in-depth investigation necessitated contacting more than 200 upper tier council authorities across the UK for details of their current and forecast financial position, including whether or not they anticipated the need for a S114 notice - effective bankruptcy.

Five councils said S114 emergency spending controls could be needed due to the impact of Covid-19. Liverpool, Birmingham and several other councils outlined the need for an emergency or in-year budget.

Nearly 150 authorities forecast a combined budget shortfall of at least £3.2bn.

It followed a report in May from the SDU on warnings the [emergency funding allocated to councils](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/coronavirus_council_funding) would not be sufficient.

This project was completed with help from the [Local Democracy Reporting Service](https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs), reporters who focus on local council matters. The LDRS is part of the Local News Partnerships alongside the Shared Data Unit.

The story was widely shared within the BBC, featuring on the BBC News at One, Six and Ten, four breakfast television programmes, and 6.30 programmes for Midlands Today, Look East (West Edition Cambs), Look North Leeds, Look North Newcastle, Look North Hull, South Today Oxford, South Today, South East Today, Northwest Tonight and Reporting Scotland.
For radio, it led bulletins on the Today programme, Radio 2, Radio 4, 5Live, included two-ways on least eight regional radio stations: Wiltshire, Shropshire, Kent, Sheffield, Lancashire, Leicester, Merseyside and Cambridge and was featured on most other England regional stations.
BBC online promoted it as the main lead on the bbc.co.uk Homepage. It also had a separate lead on [BBC Scotland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-53149054).
Several national outlets also picked up on the story.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
