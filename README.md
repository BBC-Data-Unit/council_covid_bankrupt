UK councils fear bankruptcy amid Covid-19 costs

In June 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit and BBC Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53069772) that some of the largest UK councils say they may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support.

The in-depth investigation necessitated contacting more than 200 upper tier council authorities across the UK for details of their current and forecast financial position, including whether or not they anticipated the need for a S114 notice - effective bankruptcy.

Five councils said S114 emergency spending controls could be needed due to the impact of Covid-19.

Nearly 150 authorities have forecast a combined budget shortfall of at least £3.2bn, the BBC found.

It followed a report in May from the SDU on warnings the [emergency funding allocated to councils]would not be sufficient.(https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/coronavirus_council_funding/edit/master/README.md)
